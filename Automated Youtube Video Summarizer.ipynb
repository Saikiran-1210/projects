            "India's IT sector has evolved so far out of its call center beginnings that it's now a 150 billion dollar industry. transact Global has found success by serving largely its own market is an indication of just how far the market has come. India has always had in India a fairly large stem population right we've had a history of mathematics and science and engineering and medicine back in the eighties IBM was launching a PC Microsoft was launching the desktop operating system and computers are weighing mainstream so there was an opportunity for the Indian talent to be taken to where the work was which is United States as telecom infrastructure became more stable that led to this development of offshore services.\n"
